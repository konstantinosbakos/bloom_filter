## Insight
The project consists of one class, **bloom_filter**.
- A bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is part of a set. Although false positives are possible, false negatives are not.
- In order to lessen the probability of a false positive, the use of a set of *k* hash functions as well as a large bloom filter size is encouraged.
- The bloom_filter operates bitwise on the bytes (cells) of the bloom_filter_array.
- The functions that bloom_filter contains are:
	- `bloom_filter_search()`
	- `bloom_filter_insert()`
